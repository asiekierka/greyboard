Mandatory:
* Refactor app.use in app.js.
* Refactor a LOT of other code.
* Make code run with Underscore better (throttle, isUndefined, etc.)
* Refactor room config (move to room{...})

Recommended:
* Clean up the UI [move Smoothen to a separate Brush menu. Or hide it entirely for now.]
* Start writing a roadmap for the future to consider it for future refactoring/rewrites.

Optional:
* Consider the importance of URI.js and consider removing it to save ~23kB.
